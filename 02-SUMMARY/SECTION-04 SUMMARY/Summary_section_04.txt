The topic discusses EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud, which is a virtual machine service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). EC2 allows users to create and manage virtual machines, also known as EC2 instances, and attach storage to them using Elastic Block Store (EBS). The service also offers Elastic Load Balancing, which helps distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. The second part of the topic is a demo on creating an EC2 instance and installing a web server on it. The speaker walks through the process of launching a new instance, creating a new security group, and accessing the instance using SSH.
It is a transcript of a video tutorial that explains how to create an EC2 instance on AWS. It starts by introducing the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, explaining what it is and how it works. The video then guides viewers through the process of creating an EC2 instance, including choosing the appropriate region, selecting the right Amazon Machine Image (AMI), choosing an instance type, and setting up a key pair for secure access. It also emphasizes the importance of selecting the same region for all the demos, to avoid errors. The transcript includes a brief explanation of each step, along with some additional tips and information.
The concepts discussed include Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance families, instance sizes, Elastic Block Store (EBS), security groups, and key pairs. These concepts help users choose the appropriate hardware, software, and storage for their workload on EC2, control the traffic going into their resources, and securely connect to EC2 instances using a public and private key pair.

This is a tutorial about AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) best practices. In the previous step, the process to create an AWS account was explained. Now, the focus is on IAM, which stands for Identity and Access Management. The purpose of IAM is to control access to AWS resources and to identify users. The tutorial suggests creating a new IAM user to be used for day-to-day activities, rather than using the root user. In this step, the tutorial explains how to create an IAM group called "Developers" and an IAM user named "28 minutes_def," which will be added to the "Developers" group.

In this topic, the importance of regions and zones in cloud computing was discussed. The example of an enterprise with a data center in London was used to illustrate the challenges of slow access and low availability for users from other parts of the world and in case of data center failure. The addition of a second data center in London solved the low availability issue, but the slow access issue still persisted. To solve this, a new region in Mumbai was added, creating two regions, each with two data centers. While this solved the low availability and improved access for some users, it was still not a complete solution. The addition of deployment in multiple regions around the world could fully solve the slow access issue.
